## Overview
Repo for example Groovy Scripts for Jenkins [Openshift](https://openshift.com) [Pipeline](https://jenkins.io/solutions/pipeline) Client DSL plugin.

This repo contains some template buildconfig yaml for setting up the buildconfigs, and then some clean
groovy scripts that can either be added manually to the pipeline *or* can be setup as direct git pulls
as part of a pipeline strategy buildconfig (this is the suggested way to do it)
