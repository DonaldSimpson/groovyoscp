# groovyoscp - Examples using the Openshift Jenkins Pipeline (DSL) plugin

## Overview
Repo for example Groovy Scripts for Jenkins [Openshift](https://openshift.com) Openshift [Pipeline](https://jenkins.io/solutions/pipeline)Jenkins Client DSL plugin.

This repo contains some template buildconfig yaml for setting up the buildconfigs, and then some clean
groovy scripts that can either be added manually to the pipeline *or* can be setup as direct git pulls
as part of a pipeline strategy buildconfig (this is the suggested way to do it)
